description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Things to get done for my website:
  1) Beautify said website with css.
  2) Link pictures and videos on my website.
  3) Animate everything with React.js.
  4) (Optional) Maybe set up a forums page.
  Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
